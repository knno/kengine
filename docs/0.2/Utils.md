# Utils

This library contains most functions that you can use in your project.

## Main Functions

[`Kengine.Utils.GetAsset`](Kengine.Utils?id=kengine-utils-getasset)


## Contents

The Utils library also contains other utility libraries for arrays, structs, strings ...etc.

### Parser

This library provides a way to parse external script files. It depends on a modified version of [Tiny Expression Runtime](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker/tiny-expression-runtime/) for parsing the files. Although, with some work, you can replace it with any interpreter you may already have.
